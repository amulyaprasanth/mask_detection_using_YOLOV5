# YOLOv5 Object Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project implements the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) model for real-time object detection. The notebook guides users through the entire process, from setting up the environment to training the model and testing it on various inputs. YOLOv5 is renowned for its speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for applications in computer vision. This project was completed as a major project during my Verzeo AI internship program.

## Process Description

1. **Environment Setup**: The project begins by mounting Google Drive to access necessary files and datasets. The YOLOv5 repository is then navigated to, and the required dependencies are installed.

2. **Model Importation**: The YOLOv5 model is imported using PyTorch's hub. Users can select from different model sizes, such as `yolov5s`, `yolov5m`, `yolov5l`, and `yolov5x`, depending on their specific needs for speed and accuracy.

3. **Inference**: The model is tested on sample images to demonstrate its capabilities. The inference process outputs bounding boxes around detected objects, along with class labels and confidence scores.

4. **Training the Model**: The notebook includes a section for training the YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset. Users can specify parameters such as image size, batch size, and the number of epochs. This step is crucial for adapting the model to specific detection tasks.

5. **Testing the Model**: After training, the model is tested on new images or video sources to evaluate its performance. The results are saved and can be visualized to assess the model's accuracy in real-world scenarios.

## YOLOv5 Model Highlights

- **Accuracy**: YOLOv5 is known for its high accuracy in detecting a wide range of objects. The model's architecture allows it to achieve impressive results, making it suitable for various applications.

- **Inference Time**: The model is optimized for real-time performance, with inference times typically around 20-30 milliseconds per image on a modern GPU. This rapid processing speed enables its use in applications requiring immediate feedback, such as surveillance and autonomous systems.

This project showcases the capabilities of YOLOv5 in object detection, providing a comprehensive guide for users to implement and customize the model for their specific needs.
